 * This helper class rearranges layers for optimization purposes.
 *
 * This is used by <code>BlimpSession</code> when previewing images.
 * The idea is to put layers that downscale the image data earlier in the
 * layer order so that other layers operate on smaller amounts of image
 * data, while still maintaining the most important dependencies between
 * layers.
